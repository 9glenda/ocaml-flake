Simple [flake parts](https://github.com/hercules-ci/flake-parts) module for ocaml inspired by [haskell-flake](https://github.com/srid/haskell-flake) using [opam nix](https://github.com/tweag/opam-nix).

## Thanks to 
- [haskell-flake](https://github.com/srid/haskell-flake): One of the biggest inspirations for starting this project and designing the interface was the haskell flake. It is a great `flake-parts` module for haskell and my reccomendation for everyone starting a new haskell project.
- [flake parts](https://github.com/hercules-ci/flake-parts): Obviously this project would not been possible without `flake-parts`. It's a growing ecosystem around designing clean and maintainable flakes.
- [opam nix](https://github.com/tweag/opam-nix): opam-nix is used to build the package internally.
